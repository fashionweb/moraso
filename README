== HTML.View module (since 2.3.7-39) ==

The module is a child of HTML and may be used instead of HTML (use the
configuration tab to change its behavious). HTML.View takes the HTML
content with the same index from the specified article.

== Lanuage auto-preselector listener (since 2.3.7-33) ==

The language auto-preselector listener evaluates the language accept header
and redirects the user to the start page of the evaluated language. The listener
is active, if all of the following conditions are met:

1. rewrite.uselang is set to true.
2. frontend.init.listener.Aitsu_Init_Auto_LanguagePreselector is set to true.
3. The top-level page is requested (deeper in the tree, the listener is not active).

== Referential integrity constraint on todo.idartlang (since 2.3.7-31) ==

A referential integrity constraint with cascading delete has been added on the
field idartlang in the table todo. If there are already orphaned todos, the update
will fail. If you get an exception during the update process, delete todos with
non-existing idartlang with the following query:

delete from ait_todo where idartlang not in (select distinct idartlang from ait_art_lang) 

== Remove of the internal gzhandler (since 2.3.7-30) ==

The internal gzhandler has been removed for two reasons. One is the fact that the
detection as well as the compression process is done more reliable and faster through
the appropriate server module. On the other hand you can only compress responses that
are made by aitsu. But there are other resources that are much more relevant to be
compressed, that are not compressed if it is not done by the server module. So we 
recommend either not to use compression at all or to use the server's capabilitites
to do so.

== Search.By.Tag module (since 2.3.7-9) ==

Call the module with Search.By.Tag. As as styling guide you will find an example css
file in the path /application/modules/Search/By/Tag/searchByTag.css. The module
lets you navigate through the tags used in article beneath the current category.

== Rendez-vous plugin (since 2.3.7) ==

The plugin allows to set an appointment with start and end time and periodicity of 0 (no
recurrence) to 28 (every four weeks) to an article.

== Module hierachy (since 2.3.1) ==

A module can know morph to another module which is more specific according to the
module hierarchy.

== Revision progression (since 2.2.0) ==

In the article view there is a new tab allowing you to switch between published versions of the current article. To be able to use the new feature you have to add follwing line to the default config set:

plugin.article.revisionprogression.position.default = 1000

The number after the equal symbol represents the relative position of the tab. You may change the value to something not lower than 1, which repositions the tab within the article view.
