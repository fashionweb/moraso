aitsu is reliable
-----------------
aitsu offers you an enormous amoount of functionality you can handle with ease. Togegether with fully tested core components that will be part of nearly any web site or application.
aitsu is based on professional technologies, like PHP5, mySQL5 and the ZEND frameowrk.
This all makes it a really stable system.


aitsu offers maxium flexibility
--------------------------------
aitsu will not be coded, aitsu will be configured. It is built in a way, that in most cases only the design template (view) needs
to be adapted. There is neither Typoscript nor Smarty. aitsu
is based on the ZEND framework and native PHP. It is sufficient most of the time to know about basic PHP structures and operators.


aitsu offers outstanding performance
------------------------------------
aitsu has multiple caching layers. You can also cache invidual parts of your website only. This speeds up the page delivery by far. On the other hand dynamic content elements like news tickers will stay up to date.


aitsu can be mastered fast
---------------------------
The number of operations to create an complete article is small and the user interface does not need much explanation. Also, more complex tasks like email forms, image galleries or article list can be integrated by using so called "shortcodes" at nearly any place on your website. You will get visible results simply faster with aitsu.
