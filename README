The plugin allows to set an appointment with start and end time and periodicity of 0 (no
recurrence) to 28 (every four weeks) to an article.

== Module hierachy (since 2.3.1) ==

A module can know morph to another module which is more specific according to the
module hierarchy.

== Revision progression (since 2.2.0) ==

In the article view there is a new tab allowing you to switch between published versions of the current article. To be able to use the new feature you have to add follwing line to the default config set:

plugin.article.revisionprogression.position.default = 1000

The number after the equal symbol represents the relative position of the tab. You may change the value to something not lower than 1, which repositions the tab within the article view.
