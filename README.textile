h2. Update

If you update the system just pull the master branch into your existing installation and run the update script you'll find in the backend in the top navigation: *_Management > Scripts > Update > Synchronize database structure_*.

Alternatively you may run the same script in the shell using the command (assuming, the current path is your document root):

pre. php application/cli/index.php -s Update

The suggested update procedure is as follows:

# Dump the database content.
# Optional: Make sure the dump can be restored by restoring it in an identical local installation or on a pre-production system on the server.
# Create a new branch from the master branch of your installation and call it update: _git branch update_
# Checkout the new branch: _git checkout update_
# Pull the current master branch of aitsu: _git pull origin master_
# Fix conflicts if necessary.
# Run the update script mentioned above.
# Run fix scripts mentioned beneath (if necessary, depending on the version you are updating from).
# Test the systems functionality.
# If everything is how it should be, commit the changes you made (if any).
# Change back to your master branch: _git checkout master_
# Merge the update branch into your master: _git merge update_
# Optional: Remove the update branch: _git branch -D update_
# Your done.

h3. Update from Version 2.4.3-20 or earlier

Due to a minor bug your data may contain 0 (zero) in the column pub_art_meta.schemaorgtype. After finishing the usual update procedure you should run the script that can be found at: *_Management > Scripts > Fixes > pub_art_meta.schemaorgtype, replace 0 with null_*.
