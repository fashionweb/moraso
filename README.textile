For further information on aitsu(tm) and how installation has to be done, please visit "the official website":http://www.aitsu.org/.

h2. Important notice

* If you are updating from version 2.4.3-20 or earlier, you have to run the update script mentioned "here":#fix1

h2. Update

h3. The fast way for people living on razor's edge

...or for developing, testing and pre-production systems.

To update the system just pull the master branch into your existing installation and run the update script you'll find in the backend in the top navigation: *_Management > Scripts > Update > Synchronize database structure_*.

Alternatively you may run the same script in the shell using the command line interface (assuming, the current path is your document root):

pre. php application/cli/index.php -s Update

h3. The secure way for all others

...and in particular for production systems.

The suggested update procedure is as follows:

# Dump the database content and make sure the dump can be restored by restoring it in an identical local installation or on a pre-production system on the server.
# Create a new branch from the master branch of your installation and and checkout the new branch.
# Pull the current master branch of aitsu and fix conflicts if necessary.
# Run the update script mentioned above.
# Run the fix scripts mentioned beneath (if necessary, depending on the version you are updating from).
# Test the system's functionality.
# If everything is ok, commit the changes you made (if any), change back to the master branch and merge the update branch into it.
# Your done.

Depending wether or not your data directory is under git's control, you probably want to backup its content, too. And just to be sure: if you have a pre-production system, make the update in this environment first.

h3(#fix1). Update from Version 2.4.3-20 or earlier

Due to a minor bug your data may contain 0 (zero) in the column pub_art_meta.schemaorgtype. After finishing the usual update procedure you should run the script that can be found at: *_Management > Scripts > Fixes > pub_art_meta.schemaorgtype, replace 0 with null_*.
