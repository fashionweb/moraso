h2. Installation

The installation is amazingly easy:

# Go the document root, initialize and configure git and pull aitsu's master branch.
# Create a MySQL database.
# Open /application/configs/config.ini and set the database name and the user credentials as appropriate.
# In the same file specify the installation password (setup.password).
# Log in the system on http://www.domain.tld/adm/setup/ using setup as username and your setup password.
# Run the installation script found at the screen after log in.
# Log out and log in again using admin as username and your setup password.
# Your done.

h2. Update

h3. Important notice

* Updating from version 2.4.3-20 or earlier: Due to a minor bug your data may contain 0 (zero) in the column pub_art_meta.schemaorgtype. After finishing the usual update procedure you should run the script that can be found at: *_Management > Scripts > Fixes > pub_art_meta.schemaorgtype, replace 0 with null_*.

h3. The fast way for people living on razor's edge

...or for developing, testing and pre-production systems.

To update the system just pull the master branch into your existing installation and run the update script you'll find in the backend in the top navigation: *_Management > Scripts > Update > Synchronize database structure_*.

Alternatively you may run the same script in the shell using the command line interface (assuming, the current path is your document root):

pre. php application/cli/index.php -s Update

h3. The secure way for all others

...and in particular for production systems.

The suggested update procedure is as follows:

# Dump the database content and make sure the dump can be restored by restoring it in an identical local installation or on a pre-production system on the server.
# Create a new branch from the master branch of your installation and and checkout the new branch.
# Pull the current master branch of aitsu and fix conflicts if necessary.
# Run the update script mentioned above (and the fix scripts mentioned at the outset, if necessary).
# Test the system's functionality.
# If everything is ok, commit the changes you made (if any), change back to the master branch and merge the update branch into it.
# Your done.

Depending wether or not your data directory is under git's control, you probably want to backup its content, too. And just to be sure: if you have a pre-production system, make the update in this environment first.
