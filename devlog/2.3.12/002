The module abstract class has been altered to ensure, that the module
is only executed directly (by a get request) if this has been allowed
from within the module by setting $_renderOnlyAllowed to true.

Furthermore Aitsu_Securty_Exceptions are thrown up to the bootstrap which
then logs additional information such as the ip address and hostname of
the client. The client gets a HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden header with no content.

Beginning with this revision modules may be accessed directly with one of the
following methods (if $_renderOnlyAllowed is set to true):

http(s)://my.domain.tld/my/page/?renderOnly=moduleName
http(s)://my.domain.tld/my/page/(moduleName)

The module name may contain an index (if appropriate) separated by a colon.

(The first method was possible before the current revision.)

Modules that are accessed directly (via URL) must have $_renderOnlyAllowed
of the module class set to true. Otherwise a security exception is thrown
and a forbidden header is sent to the client. Have a look into the logs to
find the modules that need to be altered.
