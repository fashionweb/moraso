== Remove of the internal gzhandler (since 2.3.7-30) ==

The internal gzhandler has been removed for two reasons. One is the fact that the
detection as well as the compression process is done more reliable and faster through
the appropriate server module. On the other hand you can only compress responses that
are made by aitsu. But there are other resources that are much more relevant to be
compressed, that are not compressed if it is not done by the server module. So we 
recommend either not to use compression at all or to use the server's capabilitites
to do so.
