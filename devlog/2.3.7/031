== Referential integrity constraint on todo.idartlang (since 2.3.7-31) ==

A referential integrity constraint with cascading delete has been added on the
field idartlang in the table todo. If there are already orphaned todos, the update
will fail. If you get an exception during the update process, delete todos with
non-existing idartlang with the following query:

delete from ait_todo where idartlang not in (select distinct idartlang from ait_art_lang)
