== Lanuage auto-preselector listener ==

The language auto-preselector listener evaluates the language accept header
and redirects the user to the start page of the evaluated language. The listener
is active, if all of the following conditions are met:

1. rewrite.uselang is set to true.
2. frontend.init.listener.Aitsu_Init_Auto_LanguagePreselector is set to true.
3. The top-level page is requested (deeper in the tree, the listener is not active).
