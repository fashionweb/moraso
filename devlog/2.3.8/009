== Google Locator Article Plugin ==

The Locator plugin takes an address, determines its coordinates, saves the data for further
use and connects the data to the article to be used in aggregations within a Google Map.

An article aggregation that returns a Google Map with markers for each article will follow
in the near future.

To enable the plugin, add following line to the default configset or a configset
of your choice:

plugin.article.googlelocator.position.default = 201

Change the value to fit your needs.
