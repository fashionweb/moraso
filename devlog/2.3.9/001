== Google.Maps.Javascript.Aggregated ==

The Google.Maps.Javascript.Aggregated module acts like an article aggregation (aka article list).
It searches for articles beneath a specified category, having the specified tags,
discriminates to articles having coordinates (which are set by the Google Locator plugin) and
returns a Google Maps with markers for each article and showing on click a bubble with the page
title, the summary, that main image (if the article has one) and a link to the article.
