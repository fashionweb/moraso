h1. Modules

A module is a class producing a content fragment that is placed into the resulting page during the rendering phase. It may produce arbitrary HTML code, which may contain references to other modules. Even a recursive call of itself is possible, as long as you implement a breaking rule to prevent the system from looping endlessly.

h2. Module call

The module is called with one of the following two references:

bc. _[My.Module.Name:Index]

This is the easy way usually used in text editors in the edit mode. As long as there is no need to configure the module programmatically, this call may be used.

If referenced from within a template or a module, most often the module has to be configured dynamically. The recommended reference looks like:

bc. <script type="application/x-aitsu" src="My.Module.Name:Index">
    paramA = My first parameter
    paramB = My second parameter
</script>

The provided index is used to distinguish between different calls of the same module within the page's context and must be provided if you allow to configure the module in the edit mode.

The index as well as the parameters are available in the modules context as...

bc. $this->_index

and

bc. $this->_params

along with the page's context, the module is embedded in.

h2. The class

The modules file name is always _Class.php_ and the class's name must correspond with its location in the file system. Modules must reside in one of the following two locations:

* /application/modules/{module name or path} or
* /application/skins/{skin name}/modules/{module name or path}

A module in _/application/modules/My/Module/Name_ must be named as:

bc. Module_My_Module_Name_Class

and is referenced as _My.Module.Name:Index_.

The same module in _/application/skins/{skin name}/module/My/Module/Name must be named as:

bc. Skin_Module_My_Module_Name_Class

and is referece exactly the same. This means that you may overwrite an existing module with a skin specific module. The system uses the skin module if available. Otherwise the one available in _/application/modules/_ is used.
