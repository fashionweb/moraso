1. Open the file /application/configs/config.ini and configure database
   settings as needed.
   
2. In the same file set the setup password (setup.password) to a value known to
   you only.
    
3. Open the file /application/configs/clients/default.ini and set the domain
   accordingly.
   
4. Allow the web server to read and write the directory /application/data, its
   content and its sub-directories.
   
5. Go to the URL http://my-domain.tld/adm/ and login with user name 'setup' and
   the setup password you set on step 2.
   
6. Click on the gear icon to start installation. This can take up to several
   minutes depending on the server's performance and the bandwidth available.
   
7. After the installation has finished log out and log in again, using 'admin' as
   user name and the password you set on step 2.
   
8. Change the admin password to a value known to you only and differing from what
   you set on step 2. The system does not force you to do so, but it is recommended
   because the password set in the config.ini is stored in plain text.
   
Depending on the configuration of the database the views may not be created with 
the user you are connecting to the database. If so, use the last eight lines of the
file /application/adm/scripts/installation/dump.sql and query the database with
different credentials allowing to create the views.
