For the sake of page load speed, CSS should always be placed in the header of the HTML document to provide information about the layout in an early stage. Javascript references as well as javascript code on the other hand, should always be placed in front of the closing body tag. Otherwise the browser stops rendering and loads the referenced javascript libraries, resulting in a much slower page rendering.
